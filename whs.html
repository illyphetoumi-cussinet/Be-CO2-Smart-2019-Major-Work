                THE NEED for WHS when making a film
            </h2>
            <p>
             Before undertaking my project, it would be highly important that I identified all possible risks that could occur during film making especially in the staging and production phase.
            </p>
            <p>After identifying and assessing the potential safety risks, I would create a document “Risk Assessment Matrix”, that set forth all safety risks and strategies to prevent or at least minimise risk occurrence. 
                </p>

            <p>This matrix would be printed and routinely referred to, especially during the production process. Copies would be created and distributed to people involved on set during production. </p>
        <p>Any person involved in this project, would always need to know and understand the safe and cooperative work practices and work environment.</p>   
        
    <h2>LEGISLATION – WHS ACT</h2>
    <p>I firstly referred to the WHS ACT, the Australian Legislation, TO ENSURE A SAFE WORKING ENVIRONMENT
            The NSW Work Health and Safety Act 2011 (WHS Act) and the NSW Work Health and Safety Regulation 2017 (WHS Regulation) define the obligations both employers and workers have to health and safety in the workplace.
            The WHS legislation is supported by Safe Work Compliance policy and prosecution guidelines, which supplements the National compliance and enforcement policy.
            If employing any person for this project I would also need to understand how businesses have to comply with the workers compensation requirements.
        </p>

        <p>There is prepared information on how to identify hazards and manage the risks common to the information media and telecommunications industry, such as:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>
            induction, instruction procedures
        </li>
        <li>elevated work platforms </li>
        <li>equipment safety</li>
        <li>heights</li>
        <li>electricity </li>
        <li>transport</li>
        <li>traffic </li>
        <li>Stunt work in film, television and video production is a significant hazard which must be managed</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Other common hazards include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>fatigue</li>
        <li>lifting heavy objects causing hernia or back disk displacement</li>
        <li>alcohol and other drugs</li>
        <li>hot and cold work environments</li>
        <li>sedentary work</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Safe Work NSW hazard library has information on how to manage hazards and risks.
        As the work health and safety regulator in NSW, Safe Work NSW has a wide range of technical, business, management and support services to help film making safe.

        <p>Evaluation: I have demonstrated that the production of a Multimedia project includes more than the WHS requirements of the video and editing production. I have demonstrated industry practice through the use of a risk matrix, I have linked to the development of the set used in the imagery for the short film production. </p>

        <h1 align=center style='font-family: Proxima Nova; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);'> <b>WHS EVALUATION - JUDGEMENTS</b> </h1>
        <p style='font-family: Proxima Nova; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);'> <b> I am satisfied with the rigorous approach I adopted towards WHS practices because it was very useful and these are the key changes I made as I evaluated my working environment:</b> 
          <br> <br> <br>
          <h2 align=center> <b>My Risk Assessment Evaluation/Judgement </h2></b> 
        <p style='font-family: Proxima Nova; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);'> <u>Evaluation/Judgement of Risk Assessment Matrix:</u>
          <p style='font-family: Proxima Nova; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);'> I was satisfied with how I listed all hazards and risks, and evaluated the importance of each and I analysed the requirement for Safe Working Practice Documentation. I realised that before undertaking my project, it would be highly important that I identified all possible risks that could occur during film making especially in the staging and production phase. After identifying and assessing the potential safety risks, I created a document “Risk Assessment Matrix”, that set forth all safety risks and strategies to prevent or at least minimise risk occurrence. This matrix was printed and referred to, during the production process. Copies were created and distributed to everyone involved on set during production to be aware and understand the safe and cooperative work practices of the work environment.</p>
          <p style='font-family: Proxima Nova; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);'> <u> Evaluation/Judgement of the Legislation – WHS ACT as applicable to this project:</u> 
            <p style='font-family: Proxima Nova; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);'> I was happy that I took the time and referred to the WHS ACT, the Australian Legislation, to ensure a safe working environment. The NSW Work Health and Safety Act 2011 (WHS Act) and the NSW Work Health and Safety Regulation 2017 (WHS Regulation) define the obligations both employers and workers have to health and safety in the workplace. The WHS legislation is supported by Safe Work Compliance policy and prosecution guidelines, which supplements the National compliance and enforcement policy. I understood that if employing any person for this project I would also need to understand how businesses have to comply with the workers compensation requirements. I discovered that there is prepared information to support the legislation on how to identify hazards and manage the risks common to the information media and telecommunications industry, such as:<br>
            - induction, instruction procedures <br>
            - elevated work platforms <br> 
            - equipment safety <br>
            - heights <br>
            - electricity<br>
            - transport<br>
            - traffic <br>
            - stunt work in film, television and video production is a significant hazard which must be managed.<br>
              <p>I had to make sure I followed all these common guidelines in order to make sure people were safe from all types of hazards such as trip hazards, wiring etc.</p> 
              <p style='font-family: Proxima Nova; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);'> <u>Evaluation/Judgement on ergonomics and my personal fatigue and comfort as the producer:</u>
              <p style='font-family: Proxima Nova; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);'>I understood that general fatigue and tiredness from long hours of work as well as lifting heavy objects can cause hernia or back disk displacement and that these are potential work risks. I learnt that high temperatures in work environments can cause dizziness and that long periods of sedentary work are not good either and that regular stretch breaks are good for productivity and healthy work practice. I also learnt that the work health and safety regulator in NSW, Safe Work NSW has a wide range of technical, business, management and support services I could call on to help filmmaking safe. </p>
        <p style='font-family: Proxima Nova; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);'>I have demonstrated that the production of a Multimedia project includes more than the WHS requirements of the video and editing production. I have demonstrated industry practice through the use of a risk matrix, I have linked to the development of the set and its various equipment tools used for the short film production.</p>
          <br><h2 align=center>My working environment Evaluation/Judgement</h2>
          <p style="font-family: Proxima Nova; color:rgb(0, 0, 0);">I have analysed the ergonomics of my environment and I'm satisfied that I have corrected lighting, chairs and tables as well as storage of my work sources and tools.</p>
        <br><h2  align=center><b>Other WHS issues/Judgement</b></h2>
        <p style="font-size: 10pt">As additional WHS issues were encountered I added them in to the risk assessment matrix therefore I am satisfied that I have included all items. </p>
